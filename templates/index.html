<h2>HEAR THE BIG WHY</h2>
	As the son of 2 teachers and a Hispanic with an advanced degree, Iâ€™ve personally experienced my parents help minorities through the educational system, while still observing underrepresentation of minorities in as I moved through the educational system.
	My proposal uses a two-class decision model to perform supervised machine learning predicting the following: 
	Based on independent variables such as household income, age, sex, etc. will a minority living in the US between the age of 25 - 29 complete a four-year degree?
	I believe the impact of identifying variables predicting whether minorities will complete college can have a broad social impact. For data to drive action, I believe it takes a storyteller who can speak to why this is important and how it can help minorities. I believe I would be well-positioned not only to tell this story.
