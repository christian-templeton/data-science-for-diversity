	According to Pew Research, only ~ 1 in every 6 Hispanics complete college. As the son of 2 teachers and a Hispanic with an advanced degree, I’ve personally experienced my parents help Hispanics through the educational system, while still observing this broader underrepresentation.
	I’m proposing using two-class decision models to perform supervised machine learning predicting the following: 
	Based on independent variables such as those listed below, will a hispanic living in the US between the age of 25 - 29 complete a four-year degree?
	I believe the impact of identifying variables predicting whether Hispanics will complete college can have a broad social impact. For data to drive action, I believe it takes a storyteller with who can speak to why this is important and how it can help the underrepresented classes of people that a model can only narrowly define. I believe I would be well-positioned not only to perform this analysis, but also to tell this story.
