<p class="padding">Part 1: The Idea<p/>

<p class="padding2">I believe in learning and inclusion. My mother immigrated from Uruguay after meeting my father in the Peace Corps. For over 30 years, both taught at Hispanic public schools in California. I grew up in a diverse neighborhood and benefitted from the accessibility of great tech companies 40 miles north. I was fortunate to join multiple companies with acceptance rates lower than top-tier universities, without having attended one myself. <p/>	
<br />

	
<p class="padding2">Three things happened to me in the fall of 2016 that gave me an idea. First, I noticed a developing trend toward more tech jobs favoring candidates with STEM backgrounds from top-tier universities. Then, I came across an article about an exclusive data science program thatâ€™s harder to get into than one of those top-tier universities. Finally, I was riding bikes with a friend who shared with me that he left that same top-tier university and taught himself programming using free resources. <p/>
<br />
	

	
<p class="padding2">Inspired by the idea that learning is accessible to anyone, anywhere, I taught myself SQL and Python. Using these new skills, I applied to that data science program I had read about. I passed the programming challenge and had the opportunity to pitch my idea for a machine learning model that identifies barriers to inclusion in education, and by extension employment. Ironically, I was accepted to their exclusive fellowship program with a pitch for making learning more inclusive. <p/>
